Altruism under Stress: Cortisol Negatively Predicts Charitable Giving and Neural Value Representations Depending on Mentalizing Capacity
Human participants (males and females) completed a charitable donation task before and after they underwent either a psychosocial stressor or a control manipulation. Although our stress manipulation per se had no influence on charitable giving, increases in the stress hormone cortisol were associated with reductions in donations in participants with high mentalizing capacity, but not in low mentalizers.

Time-dependent changes in altruistic punishment following stress
We found that stress caused a bi-directional effect on altruistic punishment, with decreased rejection rates in the late aftermath of stress in response to ambiguous 30% offers. In the Dictator Game, stressed participants were less generous than controls, but no time-dependent effect was observed, indicating that the general reward sensitivity remained unchanged at various time-points after stress.

Potential for measuring frustration with BCI.
Statistical analysis indicated that there is a significant relationship between frustration and BCI performance while the relationship between fatigue and BCI performance approached significance.

Types of brain waves.
Alpha (8-12 Hz): relaxation, mental readiness.
Beta (>12 Hz): alertness, mental activity.
Delta (0.1-3.5 Hz): deep sleep
Theta (4-8 Hz): light sleep or deep relaxation
Gamma (>30 Hz): intense focus

Is EEG suitable for Marketing Research? 
Background: neuroscience techniques to explore the conscious and unconscious drivers of consumer behavior 
EEG is one of the most frequency applied neuroscientific techniques for marketing studies because of its low cost and high temporal resolution
Objective: overview EEG applications in consumer neuroscience 
Aim to highlight reliable approaches for deriving research 
Main applications of EEG to consumer neuroscience research/suggests ways EEG technique can complement traditional experimental paradigms

A User Study of Visualization Effectiveness Using EEG and Cognitive Load
Abstract: It is difficult to effectively evaluate visualization techniques 
Usually feedback is from user studies and expert evaluations 
This presents and alternative approach to visualization evaluation (what is visualization) in which brain activity is recorded by EEGs 
Measurements used to compare different visualization techniques in terms of cognitive load (the burden they place on a viewer’s cognitive resources

EEG Oscillations to predict visual perception
Does perception fluctuate between favorable and unfavorable periods?
Role of brain oscillations in perception; critical to access the effects on a temporal scale that is more compatible with the temporal resolution of our visual experience
Used signal detection in which visual stimuli we present at the threshold, but only half were received, even though all the stimuli were identical
Average- subjects detected half of the targets
