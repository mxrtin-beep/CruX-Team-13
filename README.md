## Narrative
Intuitive and easy user experience is the cornerstone of any product or service.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) When design fails, users must tap into their limited processing power and take on cognitive load, leading to disorganization, discouragement, and poor user experience. We aim to use EEG signals to objectively measure and quantify the cognitive load experienced by a user to test and improve the usability of products and services.

## Overall Aim
We will build a program to use EEG data to measure cognitive load in real time to aid in product design.

## Specific Aims
1. Develop a method to classify cleaned literature data as the product of cognitive load or rest in a binary way.
2. Develop a method to quantify degrees of cognitive load from cleaned literature data.
3. Build a graphical user interface that can incite cognitive load in test subjects.
4. Record our own data and develop a method to remove artifacts such as blinks and facial movements from raw EEG data such that it matches the literature data.
5. Perform steps 1 and 2 with live data. Evaluate the system by performing live tests of rest and memory tasks of varying degrees of difficulty.
